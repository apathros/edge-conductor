#  E001.002
**Edge Conductor kit Config Path is not found**

*Description*
This error occurs when the kitconfigpath section is not in ep-params runtime file.

*Suggestion*
Open the ./workspace/runtime/data/ep-params file and check if "kitconfigpath" is set. Try to re-conduct "conductor init" command to repair ep-params file.
