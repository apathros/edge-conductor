#  E001.001
**Edge Conductor Kit kitconfig is not found**

*Description*
This error occurs when the kitconfig section is absent in ep-params runtime file. 

*Suggestion*
open the ./workspace/runtime/data/ep-params file and check if "kitconfig" section is existed. Re-conduct the "conductor init" command to repair the ep-params file.
